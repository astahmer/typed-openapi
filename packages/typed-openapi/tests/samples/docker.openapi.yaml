  title: Docker Engine API
  description: |
    The Engine API is an HTTP API served by Docker Engine. It is the API the
    Docker client uses to communicate with the Engine, so everything the Docker
    client can do can be done with the API.

    Most of the client's commands map directly to API endpoints (e.g. `docker ps`
    is `GET /containers/json`). The notable exception is running containers,
    which consists of several API calls.

    # Errors

    The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure
    of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following
    format:

    ```
    {
      "message": "page not found"
    }
    ```

    # Versioning

    The API is usually changed in each release, so API calls are versioned to
    ensure that clients don't break. To lock to a specific version of the API,
    you prefix the URL with its version, for example, call `/v1.30/info` to use
    the v1.30 version of the `/info` endpoint. If the API version specified in
    the URL is not supported by the daemon, a HTTP `400 Bad Request` error message
    is returned.

    If you omit the version-prefix, the current version of the API (v1.43) is used.
    For example, calling `/info` is the same as calling `/v1.43/info`. Using the
    API without a version-prefix is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

    Engine releases in the near future should support this version of the API,
    so your client will continue to work even if it is talking to a newer Engine.

    The API uses an open schema model, which means server may add extra properties
    to responses. Likewise, the server will ignore any extra query parameters and
    request body properties. When you write clients, you need to ignore additional
    properties in responses to ensure they do not break when talking to newer
    daemons.


    # Authentication

    Authentication for registries is handled client side. The client has to send
    authentication details to various endpoints that need to communicate with
    registries, such as `POST /images/(name)/push`. These are sent as
    `X-Registry-Auth` header as a [base64url encoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5)
    (JSON) string with the following structure:

    ```
    {
      "username": "string",
      "password": "string",
      "email": "string",
      "serveraddress": "string"
    }
    ```

    The `serveraddress` is a domain/IP without a protocol. Throughout this
    structure, double quotes are required.

    If you have already got an identity token from the [`/auth` endpoint](#operation/SystemAuth),
    you can just pass this instead of credentials:

    ```
    {
      "identitytoken": "9cbaf023786cd7..."
    }
    ```

      To exec a command in a container, you first need to create an exec instance,
      then start it. These two API endpoints are wrapped up in a single command-line
      command, `docker exec`.

      summary: Get container stats based on resource usage
      description: |
        This endpoint returns a live stream of a container’s resource usage
        statistics.

        The `precpu_stats` is the CPU statistic of the *previous* read, and is
        used to calculate the CPU usage percentage. It is not an exact copy
        of the `cpu_stats` field.

        If either `precpu_stats.online_cpus` or `cpu_stats.online_cpus` is
        nil then for compatibility with older daemons the length of the
        corresponding `cpu_usage.percpu_usage` array should be used.

        On a cgroup v2 host, the following fields are not set
        * `blkio_stats`: all fields other than `io_service_bytes_recursive`
        * `cpu_stats`: `cpu_usage.percpu_usage`
        * `memory_stats`: `max_usage` and `failcnt`
        Also, `memory_stats.stats` fields are incompatible with cgroup v1.

        To calculate the values shown by the `stats` command of the docker cli tool
        the following formulas can be used:
        * used_memory = `memory_stats.usage - memory_stats.stats.cache`
        * available_memory = `memory_stats.limit`
        * Memory usage % = `(used_memory / available_memory) * 100.0`
        * cpu_delta = `cpu_stats.cpu_usage.total_usage - precpu_stats.cpu_usage.total_usage`
        * system_cpu_delta = `cpu_stats.system_cpu_usage - precpu_stats.system_cpu_usage`
        * number_cpus = `lenght(cpu_stats.cpu_usage.percpu_usage)` or `cpu_stats.online_cpus`
        * CPU usage % = `(cpu_delta / system_cpu_delta) * number_cpus * 100.0`

        Use the freezer cgroup to suspend all processes in a container.

        Traditionally, when suspending a process the `SIGSTOP` signal is used,
        which is observable by the process being suspended. With the freezer
        cgroup the process is unaware, and unable to capture, that it is being
        suspended, and subsequently resumed.

      summary: Attach to a container
      description: |
        Attach to a container to read its output or send it input. You can attach
        to the same container multiple times and you can reattach to containers
        that have been detached.

        Either the `stream` or `logs` parameter must be `true` for this endpoint
        to do anything.

        See the [documentation for the `docker attach` command](/engine/reference/commandline/attach/)
        for more details.

        ### Hijacking

        This endpoint hijacks the HTTP connection to transport `stdin`, `stdout`,
        and `stderr` on the same socket.

        This is the response from the daemon for an attach request:

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream

        [STREAM]
        ```

        After the headers and two new lines, the TCP connection can now be used
        for raw, bidirectional communication between the client and server.

        To hint potential proxies about connection hijacking, the Docker client
        can also optionally send connection upgrade headers.

        For example, the client sends this request to upgrade the connection:

        ```
        POST /containers/16253994b7c4/attach?stream=1&stdout=1 HTTP/1.1
        Upgrade: tcp
        Connection: Upgrade
        ```

        The Docker daemon will respond with a `101 UPGRADED` response, and will
        similarly follow with the raw stream:

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED
        Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream
        Connection: Upgrade
        Upgrade: tcp

        [STREAM]
        ```

        ### Stream format

        When the TTY setting is disabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate),
        the HTTP Content-Type header is set to application/vnd.docker.multiplexed-stream
        and the stream over the hijacked connected is multiplexed to separate out
        `stdout` and `stderr`. The stream consists of a series of frames, each
        containing a header and a payload.

        The header contains the information which the stream writes (`stdout` or
        `stderr`). It also contains the size of the associated frame encoded in
        the last four bytes (`uint32`).

        It is encoded on the first eight bytes like this:

        ```go
        header := [8]byte{STREAM_TYPE, 0, 0, 0, SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4}
        ```

        `STREAM_TYPE` can be:

        - 0: `stdin` (is written on `stdout`)
        - 1: `stdout`
        - 2: `stderr`

        `SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4` are the four bytes of the `uint32` size
        encoded as big endian.

        Following the header is the payload, which is the specified number of
        bytes of `STREAM_TYPE`.

        The simplest way to implement this protocol is the following:

        1. Read 8 bytes.
        2. Choose `stdout` or `stderr` depending on the first byte.
        3. Extract the frame size from the last four bytes.
        4. Read the extracted size and output it on the correct output.
        5. Goto 1.

        ### Stream format when using a TTY

        When the TTY setting is enabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate),
        the stream is not multiplexed. The data exchanged over the hijacked
        connection is simply the raw data from the process PTY and client's
        `stdin`.

            This is useful for attaching to a container that has started and you
            want to output everything since the container started.

            If `stream` is also enabled, once all the previous output has been
            returned, it will seamlessly transition into streaming current
            output.

      description: |
        Build an image from a tar archive with a `Dockerfile` in it.

        The `Dockerfile` specifies how the image is built from the tar archive. It is typically in the archive's root, but can be at a different path or have a different name by specifying the `dockerfile` parameter. [See the `Dockerfile` reference for more information](/engine/reference/builder/).

        The Docker daemon performs a preliminary validation of the `Dockerfile` before starting the build, and returns an error if the syntax is incorrect. After that, each instruction is run one-by-one until the ID of the new image is output.

        The build is canceled if the client drops the connection by quitting or being killed.

            This is a base64-encoded JSON object with auth configurations for multiple registries that a build may refer to.

            The key is a registry URL, and the value is an auth configuration object, [as described in the authentication section](#section/Authentication). For example:

            ```
            {
              "docker.example.com": {
                "username": "janedoe",
                "password": "hunter2"

            }
            ```

            Only the registry domain name (and port if not the default 443) are required. However, for legacy reasons, the Docker Hub registry must be specified with both a `https://` prefix and a `/v1/` suffix even though Docker will prefer to use the v2 registry API.

            Supported `Dockerfile` instructions:

            Platform in the format os[/arch[/variant]].

            When used in combination with the `fromImage` option, the daemon checks
            if the given image is present in the local image cache with the given
            OS and Architecture, and otherwise attempts to pull the image. If the
            option is not set, the host's native OS and Architecture are used.
            If the given image does not exist in the local image cache, the daemon
            attempts to pull the image with the host's native OS and Architecture.
            If the given image does exists in the local image cache, but its OS or
            architecture does not match, a warning is produced.

            When used with the `fromSrc` option to import an image from an archive,
            this option sets the platform information for the imported image. If
            the option is not set, the host's native OS and Architecture are used
            for the imported image.

        Stream real-time events from the server.

        Various objects within Docker report events when something happens to them.

        Containers report these events: `attach`, `commit`, `copy`, `create`, `destroy`, `detach`, `die`, `exec_create`, `exec_detach`, `exec_start`, `exec_die`, `export`, `health_status`, `kill`, `oom`, `pause`, `rename`, `resize`, `restart`, `start`, `stop`, `top`, `unpause`, `update`, and `prune`

        Images report these events: `delete`, `import`, `load`, `pull`, `push`, `save`, `tag`, `untag`, and `prune`

        Volumes report these events: `create`, `mount`, `unmount`, `destroy`, and `prune`

        Networks report these events: `create`, `connect`, `disconnect`, `destroy`, `update`, `remove`, and `prune`

        The Docker daemon reports these events: `reload`

        Services report these events: `create`, `update`, and `remove`

        Nodes report these events: `create`, `update`, and `remove`

        Secrets report these events: `create`, `update`, and `remove`

        Configs report these events: `create`, `update`, and `remove`

        The Builder reports `prune` events

      tags:
        - Image
      summary: Export an image
      description: |
        Get a tarball containing all images and metadata for a repository.

        If `name` is a specific name and tag (e.g. `ubuntu:latest`), then only that image (and its parents) are returned. If `name` is an image ID, similarly only that image (and its parents) are returned, but with the exclusion of the `repositories` file in the tarball, as there were no image names referenced.

        ### Image tarball format

        An image tarball contains one directory per image layer (named using its long ID), each containing these files:

        - `VERSION`: currently `1.0` - the file format version
        - `json`: detailed layer information, similar to `docker inspect layer_id`
        - `layer.tar`: A tarfile containing the filesystem changes in this layer

        The `layer.tar` file contains `aufs` style `.wh..wh.aufs` files and directories for storing attribute changes and deletions.

        If the tarball defines a repository, the tarball should also include a `repositories` file at the root that contains a list of repository and tag names mapped to layer IDs.

        ```json
        {
          "hello-world": {
            "latest": "565a9d68a73f6706862bfe8409a7f659776d4d60a8d096eb4a3cbce6999cc2a1"
          }

                    Check for networks with duplicate names. Since Network is
                    primarily keyed based on a random ID and not on the name, and
                    network name is strictly a user-friendly alias to the network
                    which is uniquely identified using ID, there is no guaranteed
                    way to check for duplicates. CheckDuplicate is there to provide
                    a best effort checking of any networks which has the same name
                    but it is not guaranteed to catch all name collisions.

        ### Hijacking

        This endpoint hijacks the HTTP connection to HTTP2 transport that allows
        the client to expose gPRC services on that connection.

        For example, the client sends this request to upgrade the connection:

        ```
        POST /session HTTP/1.1
        Upgrade: h2c
        Connection: Upgrade
        ```

        The Docker daemon responds with a `101 UPGRADED` response follow with
        the raw stream:

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED
        Connection: Upgrade
        Upgrade: h2c
        ```

            The mount type:

            - `bind` a mount of a file or directory from the host into the container.
            - `volume` a docker volume with the given `Name`.
            - `tmpfs` a `tmpfs`.
            - `npipe` a named pipe from the host into the container.
            - `cluster` a Swarm cluster volume
          example: volume
          enum:
            - bind
            - volume

        Name:
          type: string
          description: |
            Name is the name reference to the underlying data defined by `Source`

          example: myvolume
        Source:
          type: string
          description: |
            Source location of the mount.

            For volumes, this contains the storage location of the volume (within
            `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`). For bind-mounts, and `npipe`, this contains
            the source (host) part of the bind-mount. For `tmpfs` mount points, this
            field is empty.
          example: /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvolume/_data
        Destination:
          type: string
          description: |
            Destination is the path relative to the container root (`/`) where
            the `Source` is mounted inside the container.
          example: /usr/share/nginx/html/
        Driver:
          type: string

          description: |
            Mode is a comma separated list of options supplied by the user when
            creating the bind/volume mount.

            The default is platform-specific (`"z"` on Linux, empty on Windows).

          description: |
            Propagation describes how mounts are propagated from the host into the

              type: array
              description: |
                A list of volume bindings for this container. Each volume binding
                is a string in one of these forms:

                - `host-src:container-dest[:options]` to bind-mount a host path
                  into the container. Both `host-src`, and `container-dest` must
                  be an _absolute_ path.
                - `volume-name:container-dest[:options]` to bind-mount a volume
                  managed by a volume driver into the container. `container-dest`
                  must be an _absolute_ path.

                `options` is an optional, comma-delimited list of:

                - `nocopy` disables automatic copying of data from the container
                  path to the volume. The `nocopy` flag only applies to named volumes.
                - `[ro|rw]` mounts a volume read-only or read-write, respectively.
                  If omitted or set to `rw`, volumes are mounted read-write.
                - `[z|Z]` applies SELinux labels to allow or deny multiple containers
                  to read and write to the same volume.
                    - `z`: a _shared_ content label is applied to the content. This
                      label indicates that multiple containers can share the volume
                      content, for both reading and writing.
                    - `Z`: a _private unshared_ label is applied to the content.
                      This label indicates that only the current container can use
                      a private volume. Labeling systems such as SELinux require
                      proper labels to be placed on volume content that is mounted
                      into a container. Without a label, the security system can
                      prevent a container's processes from using the content. By
                      default, the labels set by the host operating system are not
                      modified.
                - `[[r]shared|[r]slave|[r]private]` specifies mount
                  [propagation behavior](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt).
                  This only applies to bind-mounted volumes, not internal volumes
                  or named volumes. Mount propagation requires the source mount
                  point (the location where the source directory is mounted in the
                  host operating system) to have the correct propagation properties.
                  For shared volumes, the source mount point must be set to `shared`.
                  For slave volumes, the mount must be set to either `shared` or
                  `slave`.

            ID is the content-addressable ID of an image.

            This identifier is a content-addressable digest calculated from the
            image's configuration (which includes the digests of layers used by
            the image).

            Note that this digest differs from the `RepoDigests` below, which
            holds digests of image manifests that reference the image.

            These digests are usually only available if the image was either pulled
            from a registry, or if the image was pushed to a registry, which is when
            the manifest is generated and its digest calculated.

            In versions of Docker before v1.10, this field was calculated from
            the image itself and all of its parent images. Images are now stored
            self-contained, and no longer use a parent-chain, making this field
            an equivalent of the Size field.

            Deprecated: this field is kept for backward compatibility, and will be removed in API v1.44.

        The version number of the object such as node, service, etc. This is needed
        to avoid conflicting writes. The client must send the version number along
        with the modified specification when updating these objects.

        This approach ensures safe concurrency and determinism in that the change
        on the object may not be applied if the version number has changed from the
        last read. In other words, if two update requests specify the same base
        version, only one of the requests can succeed. As a result, two separate
        update requests that happen at the same time will not unintentionally
        overwrite each other.

                An array of constraint expressions to limit the set of nodes where
                a task can be scheduled. Constraint expressions can either use a
                _match_ (`==`) or _exclude_ (`!=`) rule. Multiple constraints find
                nodes that satisfy every expression (AND match). Constraints can
                match node or Docker Engine labels as follows:

                node attribute       | matches                        | example

                `engine.labels` apply to Docker Engine labels like operating system,
                drivers, etc. Swarm administrators add `node.labels` for operational
                purposes by using the [`node update endpoint`](#operation/NodeUpdate).

            Whether this container is running.

            Note that a running container can be _paused_. The `Running` and `Paused`
            booleans are not mutually exclusive:

            When pausing a container (on Linux), the freezer cgroup is used to suspend
            all processes in the container. Freezing the process requires the process to
            be running. As a result, paused containers are both `Running` _and_ `Paused`.

            Use the `Status` field instead to determine if a container's state is "running".
          example: true
        Paused:
          type: boolean
          description: Whether this container is paused.

            By default, local registries (`127.0.0.0/8`) are configured as

          description: |
            Group defines the volume group of this volume. Volumes belonging to
            the same group can be referred to by group name when creating
            Services.  Referring to a volume by group instructs Swarm to treat
            volumes in that group interchangeably for the purpose of scheduling.
            Volumes with an empty string for a group technically all belong to
            the same, emptystring group.
